# Functions-1
## In a folder labeled as "functions1" inside github upload the next scripts (the scripts must run in repl.it ) NOTE: just upload the link to your github folder (2 points each one) 
### 1.-create a function that receives a string and print the inverted string, remember that to print an element i you can use printf("%c",string[i]); 

```python
def reverse(s): 
  str = "" 
  for i in s: 
    str = i + str
    print(reverse):
  return str
```

### 2.-create a function that returns 0 if both have the same length and 1 if is different.
```python
def no(l1, l2):
    if not l1 and not l2:
        return True

    if len(l1) != len(l2):
        return (0)
 elif (no)

   
    return no(l1, l2)
```
